    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
      Scammers use psychological manipulation to persuade people into
      revealing sensitive information or sending money. These methods
      are designed to bypass rational thinking.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
      A common tactic is impersonation. By posing as trusted institutions
      such as banks or technical support, scammers lower a person’s
      defenses and gain credibility.

      Urgency is frequently used to force quick decisions,
      preventing victims from verifying information or asking for help.
