  <p style="font-size: 18px;">Scammers increasingly use psychological tactics to deceive people into compromising their data or money. Even experienced internet users can be tricked by these sophisticated strategies. </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    One common approach is <strong>impersonating a trusted entity</strong>—such as tech support, a bank, or a friend—so victims let their guard down. Another is creating intense <strong>urgency and fear</strong> to make someone act before thinking.  
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Scammers often manipulate emotions like love, trust, and panic, leading people to make decisions they wouldn’t under calm conditions. Staying aware of these psychological levers can help protect you and others.
