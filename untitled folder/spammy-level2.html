	You might receive an email that <em> looks</em> like it’s from your boss, a company you’ve done
	<br> business with, or even from someone in your family—but it <b>actually isn’t</b>.

	<p> <h2> How To <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Protect</span> Yourself</h2></p>
	<ul>
	<li><p> Remember that companies generally don’t contact you to ask for your username or password. </p></li>
	<li><p> Don’t click on anything in an unsolicited email or text message. Look up the company’s phone number on your own (don’t use the one a potential scammer is providing), and call the company to ask if the request is legitimate. </p></li>
	<li><p>&nbsp;Carefully examine the email address, URL, and spelling used in any correspondence. Scammers use slight differences to trick your eye and gain your trust.<br></p></li>
	<li><p>&nbsp;Be careful what you download. Never open an email attachment from someone you don’t know and be wary of email attachments forwarded to you.<br></p></li>
	<li><p>&nbsp;Set up two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication on any account that allows it, and never disable it.<br></p></li>
	<li><p>&nbsp;Be careful with what information you share online or on social media. By openly sharing things like pet names, schools you attended, family members, and your birthday, you can give a scammer all the information they need to guess your password or answer your security questions.<br></p></li>
</ul>
