    <p>You might receive an email that <em>looks</em> like it’s from your boss, a company you’ve done business with, or even from someone in your family—but it <b>actually isn’t.</b></p>

    <h2>How To <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Protect</span> Yourself</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remember that companies generally don’t contact you to ask for your username or password.</li>
        <li>Don’t click on anything in an unsolicited email or text message. Look up the company’s phone number on your own (don’t use the one a potential scammer is providing), and call the company to ask if the request is legitimate.</li>
        <li>Carefully examine the email address, URL, and spelling used in any correspondence. Scammers use slight differences to trick your eye and gain your trust.</li>
        <li>Be careful what you download. Never open an email attachment from someone you don’t know and be wary of email attachments forwarded to you.</li>
        <li>Set up two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication on any account that allows it, and never disable it.</li>
        <li>Be careful with what information you share online or on social media. By openly sharing things like pet names, schools you attended, family members, and your birthday, you can give a scammer all the information they need to guess your password or answer your security questions.</li>
    </ul>
