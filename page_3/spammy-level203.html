	<p> First, make sure your computer security software is up to date, then run a scan. <br> If the scan identifies suspicious software, delete it, and restart your computer.<br> Then, follow the provider’s account recovery instructions. </p>
	<p> <h2>Check for signs that someone had access to your account </h2></p>
	
	<ol><li><p> &nbsp; Check your email settings to see if there are rules set up to forward emails. Delete any rules you didn’t set up, so your messages aren’t forwarded to someone else’s address.</p></li>
	<p> <li> &nbsp; Check your sent folder for emails the hacker sent from your account. Look in your deleted folder for emails the hacker may have read then deleted.</p></li>
	<p> <li> &nbsp; Check your social media accounts for messages the hacker posted or sent from your account, or for new friends you don’t recognize.</p></li>
