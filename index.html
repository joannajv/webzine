	Hacked means you have no control.
</p>

	You might receive an email that looks like it’s from your boss, a company you’ve done
	<br> business with, or even from someone in your family—but it actually isn’t.

	<p> How To Protect Yourself</p>
	<p>&nbsp; Remember that companies generally don’t contact you to ask for your username or password. <br></p>
	<p>&nbsp; Don’t click on anything in an unsolicited email or text message. Look up the company’s phone number on your own (don’t use the one a potential scammer is providing), and call the company to ask if the request is legitimate. <br></p>
	<p>&nbsp;Carefully examine the email address, URL, and spelling used in any correspondence. Scammers use slight differences to trick your eye and gain your trust.<br></p>
	<p>&nbsp;Be careful what you download. Never open an email attachment from someone you don’t know and be wary of email attachments forwarded to you.<br></p>
	<p>&nbsp;Set up two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication on any account that allows it, and never disable it.<br></p>
	<p>&nbsp;Be careful with what information you share online or on social media. By openly sharing things like pet names, schools you attended, family members, and your birthday, you can give a scammer all the information they need to guess your password or answer your security questions.<br></p>
