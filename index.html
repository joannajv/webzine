      <h2>AVOID A <b>BAD</b> SITUATION</h2>
      <h4> By Joanna Villatoro Ayala </h4>
      
      <p> I wasn't able to run into scams as a kid because I had a computer and no internet. The most I did was burn CDs. My parents thought I would become what Gen Alpha is basically. Mind you I had a little ahh phone until 5th grade when I begged my dad for an iPhone. I couldn't even surf the depths of the web like that cause mfs had a data plan that lasted half a second and then boom "VERIZON ALERT YOU ARE 95% THROUGH YOUR DATA". I was always going over the limit and then getting in trouble. So I didn't even have time to get scammed. So the lesson is perhaps let your kids be iPad kids without having connection to internet or .. orrr do whatever you want. Until one day your child buys a few hundred dollars of Robux or a new Fortnite skin off your card. Or maybe your kids aren't that evil or you know what let them? Everyone makes mistakes. Some are just worse than others and some cost a lot of money. Like everytime I went over the data plan, I wasn't evil. I was just whimsy and they weren't messing with my child-like wonder of browsing the internet. I couldn't just stay curious I wanted to know what they people were saying on twitter, what the girls posted on instagram, and watch Youtube. My dad actually ended up canceling the verizon phones because I had very little self control at eleven. I was always racking up the bill. So we got prepaid phones and when the data ran out, it was out and extremely slow. If I was patient though I could see what the world was doing on twitter I just couldn't watch videos or see pictures. They took fiveeverrr to load. Anyways I struggled with that for a while because again I was going to essentially join forces with Gen Alpha according to my parents. So I never got scammed but you could get scammed. Anything is possible guys. That what this sketchy looking website is for. Becareful surfing the internet but also don't be scared. </p>
