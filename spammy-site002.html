	<P> How To Know If You've Been Hacked ? </P> 
	<p> &nbsp;You get a ransome message</p>
	<p> One of the worst messages anyone can see on their computer is a sudden screen take-over telling them all their data is encrypted <br> and asking for a payment to unlock it. Ransomware is huge! After a slight decrease in activity in 2017, ransom-asking programs <br> have come roaring back. Billions of dollars in productivity is being lost and billions in ransom are being paid. Small businesses,<br> large businesses, hospitals, police stations and entire cities are being brought to a halt by ransomware. About 50% of the victims <br> pay the ransom, ensuring that it isn’t going away anytime soon. Unfortunately, according to cybersecurity insurance firms who are often involved in the payouts, paying the ransom does not result in working systems about 40% of the time. Turns out that ransomware programs aren’t bug free and unlocking indiscriminately encrypted linked systems isn’t as easy as putting in a decryption key. Most victims end up with many days of downtime and additional recovery steps even if they do pay the ransom.</p>
	<p> &nbsp;You get a fake antivirus message</p>
	<p> You get a popup message on your computer or mobile device that it is infected. The pop-up message pretends to be an antivirus scanning product and is purporting to have found a dozen or more malware infections on your computer. Although this isn’t near as popular as it used to be, fake antivirus warning messages are still a situation that has to be dealt with in the right way. They can occur because of two reasons: Either your system is already compromised or it is not compromised beyond the pop-up message. Hope for the latter. These types of fake antivirus messages usually have figured out a way to lock up your browser so that you can’t get out of the fake message without killing the browser and restarting it. </p>
	<p> &nbsp;You have unwanted browser toolbars </p>
	<p> This is a common sign of exploitation: Your browser has multiple new toolbars with names that seem to indicate the toolbar is supposed to help you. Unless you recognize the toolbar as coming from a well-known vendor, it’s time to dump the bogus toolbar. </p>
